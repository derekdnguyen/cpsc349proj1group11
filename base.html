        <h1>Project Description & Credits</h1>
        <p> This project was designed by Geoff Mendoza and Marl Kristoffer Rico. This is a website that we designed to display stock images of deserts that were taken by numerous different photographers.
            These photos were provided to us by Pexels, a free stock photo and video website that is shared by many creators. </p>
